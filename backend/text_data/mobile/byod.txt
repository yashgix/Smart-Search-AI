## Frequently asked questions

### What is eSIM?

eSIM is an embedded version of a SIM card that’s already built into compatible devices. It allows you to activate your phone without a physical SIM card – no shipping necessary. Simply select to bring your own phone after choosing your data option, and check if your phone is eSIM compatible. Not compatible? No problem. We can send you a physical SIM card with free 2-day shipping, or you can pick one up at an Xfinity Store near you.

[Learn more about eSIM](https://www.xfinity.com/learn/mobile/esim#:~:text=An%20eSIM%20is%20a%20digital%20SIM%20that%20eliminates%20the%20need,new%20mobile%20plan%2C%20all%20digitally)

### What’s an unlocked phone?

When a phone is unlocked, it means it can be used on different carriers. Many phones are locked to the carrier they were purchased from, but can usually be unlocked once the phone has been fully paid for. Check with your current carrier if you're unsure. Only unlocked phones can come to Xfinity Mobile.

### Why are some devices compatible and others aren’t?

Different carriers use different network technology, and as a result, not all phones are made for all networks. So when a phone is made for use on one carrier, it may not be compatible with the technology used on another.

### Which phones are compatible with Xfinity Mobile?

You can bring all iPhones\*, starting with the iPhone 6 or later (including the iPhone SE), to Xfinity Mobile. Select Galaxy and Pixel phones are compatible, too. The only way to know for sure is to use our Compatibility Checker, but don't worry — we'll walk you through each step, and checking your phone doesn't mean you're signing up for Xfinity Mobile. \*Select carriers
