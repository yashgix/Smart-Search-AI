### Find out if your equipment is approved and compatible with Comcast Business services

1. Before buying your own equipment, you must first ensure the services you subscribe to are “Bring your Own” eligible. Certain Comcast business products and services are only available with equipment leased from Comcast Business. For certain Comcast Business products and services, you will be required to use Comcast Business equipment.





|     |     |     |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Comcast Business Product** | **Comcast Modem / Device Eligible?** | **Bring Your Own Eligible?** |
| Internet Only | ✓ | Yes |
| Internet with Static IP | ✓ | No |
| Internet with Connection Pro | ✓ | No |
| Internet with SmartOffice | ✓ | No |
| Internet with WiFi Pro | ✓ | No |
| Internet with SecurityEdge ™ | ✓ | No |
| Voice | ✓ | No |

2. Once you confirm that your Comcast Business service is “Bring your Own” eligible, use the tables below to easily check if your device is approved for Comcast Business Internet service.
   - You can also use this table to make sure your modem or router supports your selected internet speed tier.
3. After checking this website for approved retail devices, visit [https://business.comcast.com/shop/gateway](https://business.comcast.com/shop/gateway) for up-to-date information on the internet speeds and other offers available in your area.

Verify your speed tier by consulting your monthly Internet billing statement. [Click here](http://media2.comcast.net/anon.comcastonline2/support/helpandsupport/businessclass/help_articles/HOW6298_Sample_Bill.jpg) to see where this information is located on the bill.

### Identify approved retail devices

Before buying a retail device through a third-party retailer, please review the below tables to better understand which devices are approved by Comcast. For more details, see the Frequently Asked Questions section.

Every device listed below is either DOCSIS 3.0 or 3.1 and is IPv6 compatible.

**IMPORTANT:** If you choose to purchase one of the below modems instead of leasing equipment from Comcast, it is important to understand that:

- Modem/gateway performance may degrade over time, and certain modems/gateways are not capable of handling higher speeds;
- The below devices can only achieve a maximum upload speed of 35 Mbps;
- Even if you purchase one of the modems identified below, Comcast cannot guarantee that you will achieve the Business Internet speeds to which you subscribe at all times. The “actual” speed that a customer will experience while using the service depends upon a variety of conditions, many of which are beyond the control of Comcast as an Internet service provider.

If you choose to use a dual-function device with cable modem and Wi-Fi router in a single unit, you must lease a device from Comcast. If you are using your own purchased Wi-Fi router, you can use it in conjunction with an approved retail cable modem (listed below) or with a Comcast provided modem.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I bring my own equipment to Comcast?**

You can purchase your own retail modem for use with your Business Internet service, as long as the equipment is certified to work on our network, and your service is “Bring Your Own” eligible. Before buying from the retailer of your choice, please reference the tables above to find certified retail equipment that supports your internet speed tier.

If you're an existing customer and need to know your level of service, see which [level of service you subscribe to](http://media2.comcast.net/anon.comcastonline2/support/helpandsupport/businessclass/help_articles/HOW6298_Sample_Bill.jpg). Then, after buying compatible retail equipment, install and activate it and start enjoying your service.

**What are my responsibilities when buying and using my own equipment with Comcast Business service?**

You're responsible for making sure your retail device is secure and certified, that it supports your Comcast Business Internet service speed, and for upgrading your equipment when we increase speeds. We recommend that you stay aware of new developments in technology to better understand when replacing your retail device may be necessary.

You'll be responsible for troubleshooting device-related issues using the manufacturer's user manual if we've confirmed that your Comcast Business Internet service is functioning properly. You'll also be responsible for configuring your wireless network's security settings, if applicable.

**What does it mean if my equipment isn't supported, and how do I check if a piece of equipment isn't supported?**

If a device isn't supported, it's not certified for use on our network and won't be activated as new or replacement equipment. You can check if a piece of equipment isn't supported using the tables above.

As new technology emerges, older devices become obsolete and will not work with new features or deliver subscribed Internet speeds. These older devices are deemed to be at the end of their useful life which means we no longer install the device and recommend that customers do not purchase these devices, whether new or used.

Reference this table to see if your modem is an end-of-life device and not recommended for use.

| **Starter Speed Tier** |
| **Vendor** | **Model** | **Product Name** |
| SMC Networks | SMC8013WG-ADC | SMC EZ Connect Wireless Cable Modem Gateway |

| SMC Networks | SMC8013WG-CCR | SMC EZ Connect Wireless Cable Modem Gateway |
| SMC Networks | SMC8014WG-CCR | SMC EZ Connect Cable Modem Gateway |

**What should I do if my older retail equipment isn't supported?**

To get the most out of your service, you should consider replacing your retail equipment if it has been identified as not supported. You have the option to replace your older retail device by leasing a wireless gateway, or by purchasing a certified and compatible device listed above. To learn more about the Comcast Business Wireless Gateway, see [Overview of the Business Wireless Gateway and Comcast Business Router](https://business.comcast.com/support/article/internet/comcast-business-wireless-gateway-overview-wifi).
