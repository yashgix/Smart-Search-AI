Unlike traditional home phones, Xfinity Voice operates over a connection using Internet protocol technology to give you amazing call clarity and other great features. That means it requires a voice modem to work. Our Wireless Gateway is a voice modem and WiFi router in one, connecting you to Xfinity Voice and providing fast Xfinity Internet throughout your home.
