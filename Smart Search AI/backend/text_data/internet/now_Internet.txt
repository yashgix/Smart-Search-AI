## FAQ

NOW Internet is a new prepaid high-speed home internet option backed by the reliable Xfinity network to give you a consistent connection at a great value. It’s perfect for those looking for a straightforward, prepaid internet option with no credit checks or long-term agreements. With NOW Internet, you get unlimited data and WiFi equipment that you don’t have to worry about returning. You can activate your service in minutes on the Xfinity app.

For faster home internet speeds from 300 Mbps to 10 gigs, you can [explore Xfinity Internet](https://www.xfinity.com/learn/internet-service) and other services like home security, entertainment, and home phones.
